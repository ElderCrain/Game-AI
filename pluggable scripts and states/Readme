This is a state machine tutorial. Located here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/navigation/patrol-action?playlist=17105

That is the specific video where the error arose. 

The "StateController", where the error is, is supposed to refer back to "State" for the "UpdateState" 
function but is saying that it's not set to an instance... The video went through this with no errors and the supplied code 
matches the sources on the tutorial page
